# data-science

Repository for teaching materials and notes on data science. Notes will be
based on R and Python 3, trying to replicate tasks in both languages.

## R and Python Machine Learning

The [`caret` R package][caret] and [`scikit-learn` Python package][sklearn] are
two analogous software packages for R and Python to perform machine learning in
a unified framework.

`caret` is a wrapper package around the main machine learning packages to give
a consistent interface for typical machine learning and predictive learning
tasks.

`scikit-learn` has the machine learning algorithms and task functions built-in.

[Here][caretvid] (`1:09:37`) is a good starter video on learning aspects of
`caret` and [here][sklearnvid] (Part 1 `51:17`, Part 2 `1:11:27`, Part 3
`1:37:35`) are good starter videos on learning `scikit-learn`.
